# Digit Images - Emerging Technologies
This [project](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/project.html) is for the [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/) module in the Software Development course I am part taking in. The aim of the project is to read an image that will either be drawn by the user or in a file the user will upload the the web application. I will be using TenserFlow and Flask to do the web app.

For this project we are expected to create a web application that will allow a user to upload an image from their computer or draw a digit in the canvas (if I ever figure it out) and then have that digit compare against the MNIST data set to provide a prediciton on what the digit may be. This project is very intersting and I am learning a lot but I am stuggling massively with trying to get things to work. 

## What software did I use?
For this project I used basic HTML will bootstrap and some javascript for the frontend. For the backend we were asking to use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and we had a choice of using [Keras](https://keras.io/) or [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or anything similar in Python to run the data and create a neural network. I chose tensorflow solely to challenge myself, as we used keras to train a modle for a problem sheet we completed as part of this module also.
