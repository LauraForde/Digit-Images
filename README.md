# Digit Images - Emerging Technologies
This [project](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/project.html) is for the [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/) module in the Software Development course I am part taking in. The aim of the project is to read an image that will either be drawn by the user or in a file the user will upload the the web application. I will be using TenserFlow and Flask to do the web app.
